#Webmarks

#Overview
Webmarks is a bookmark sharing app that allows users to save bookmarks into topics, like other user's bookmarks, and allow users to add bookmarks to their personal list via email.

##Using Webmarks
Sign up for an account or use one of the following test credentials:
* ```admin@webmarks.com / password```
* ```member@webmarks.com / password```

Afterward, you may **Create a New Topic**, **Create a New Bookmark**, **Visit a Bookmark**, or **Like a Bookmark**.

###Create a New Topic
Click on ```New Topic``` to start a new topic. You will be prompted to give the topic a name. Upon inputting the name, you will be directed to the Topic's page. Here you can **Create a New Bookmark** as you would from the landing page.

###Create a New Bookmark
Click the green ```+``` to create a bookmark. You will be prompted to input a url (including ```http://www.```). Upon creating the bookmark, you will be redirected to its parent Topic page, with an auto-generated image included for that link.

###Like a Bookmark
Click the star below a bookmark to like it. Liked bookmarks are saved in a *Liked Bookmarks* section of their User profile.

###Create a Bookmark via Email
If you want to add a bookmark via email, send an email to ```postmaster@app87ca224351ca4e7591adbbe43897649b.mailgun.org```. If your email was sent from a recognized user, it will use the subject line of your email as the Topic and the body as the url for your bookmark, displaying it to your bookmark list.
